# Contributing

First off, thank you for your interest!

## Issues
Feel free to create any issues you encounter [here](https://github.com/gpajot/zen-config/issues).

## Submitting pull requests
If you would rather fix or propose changes yourself, first set up your environment:
- have a supported python version installed
- have [poetry>=1.2](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer) installed
- create a fork and clone it
- run `poetry install --all-extras`
- optionally run `poetry run pre-commit install` to set up hooks

Then submit your PR.
